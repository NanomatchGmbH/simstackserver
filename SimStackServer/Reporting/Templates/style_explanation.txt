The report is basically an indented list of modules, which were run. Modules can have submodules like this

|Module1
|-Module2
|-Module3
|Module4
|-Module5
|--Module6
|--Module7
|--Module8
|Module9

Currently we model the indentation in the tree above using <li, ul elements, i.e
Module1, Module4 and Module9 are in the same list <li>
Module2 and Module3 are a sublist of Module1

<li has class indent>, ul has no class itself, but a class can be added on request.




Every single WaNo generates a report such as this:

If WaNo failed, class will be class="wano failed" -> red-ish background
If WaNo not failed, class will be class="wano"

Two or three subelements will be generate

<p (or div)>, can be changed on request of Style Generator:
p class report: First part of the report, should be presented centrally

p clsas files: List of files, should expose a nice table style for a nice file exporer view

p class result: List of result conditions, which were met (green style) or not (red style)
